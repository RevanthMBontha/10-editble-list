# 10_Editable_ToDo_List

This is a component that create an editable toDo list. You can add new tasks to the list, as long as the task itself is not empty. Once you add a task you can either edit the task or delete the task. You can also use the clear items button to clear all the tasks at once. Any action towards the list cause an alert to pop up which either shows a success or a warning message. This stub also uses local storage to persist the list across sessions and refreshes.
